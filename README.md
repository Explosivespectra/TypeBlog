# About TypeBlog

This project was originally intended to be a minor project to get used to TypeScript; despite that, plans and the intended vision for what this application was going to be has changed.  Now, TypeBlog (the name of this repo really should be adjusted) is a WIP restaurant mock-up, making use of a NodeJS Express back-end that serves data via a GraphQL API to a front-end based on ReactJS utilizing Apollo Client, Material-UI, Redux, and some additional assets from the mobile/PC game Genshin Impact.
